# YourTune

YourTune is an app created for the 2nd group project of my Bootcamp. It was made using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, Sass and Axios.

The idea behind YourTune is providing a platform for musicians to sell their music, and for youtubers/twitch streamers to find reasonably priced music for their channels. Authors can upload their music and set a price for it and users can add tracks to their shopping cart for eventual checkout.

Using SoundCloud's widgets allowed me to easily create a Handlebars partial that could play music and linked back to the artist's SoundCloud account.
